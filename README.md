# The Lightbulb website ðŸ’¡

<p justify-content>In this website there is an interaction. It is possible to turn on and off the light and also crack it.

This page was built with the aim to practice the interactive with JavaScript and also apply knowledge I've got during my studies.

When passing the cursor over the bulb it's turn on the light. Taking the cursor out, the light is off. When clicking the bulb, it breaks. These effects are possible due to the use of functions in the code.
